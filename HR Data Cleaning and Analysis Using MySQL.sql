-- to the '%Y-%m-%d' format. If it contains a dash '-', we assume the format is '%m-%d-%y' and convert the value 
-- to the '%Y-%m-%d' format. If the value does not match either format, we set the birthdate value to NULL.

-- Note that the DATE_FORMAT() function is used to convert the value to the '%Y-%m-%d' format, which is the 
-- standard MySQL date format. You can adjust the format string in the DATE_FORMAT() function to match your 
-- specific needs if you prefer a different date format.**

-- 8. Which department has the highest turnover rate? 

-- "Turnover rate" typically refers to the rate at which employees leave a company or department and 
-- need to be replaced. It can be calculated as the number of employees who leave over a given time period
-- divided by the average number of employees in the company or department over that same time period.

-- 10. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?

SELECT MIN(hire_date), MAX(hire_date) FROM hr;

-- This query groups the employees by the year of their hire date and calculates the total number of hires,
-- terminations, and net change (the difference between hires and terminations) for each year. The results 
-- are sorted by year in ascending order.

SELECT 
    YEAR(hire_date) AS year,

FROM 
    hr
WHERE age >= 18
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(hire_date)
ORDER BY 
    YEAR(hire_date) ASC;

-- In this modified query, a subquery is used to first calculate the terminations alias, which is then used
-- in the calculation for the net_change and net_change_percent column in the outer query.

SELECT 
	year,

    FROM hr
    WHERE age > 18
    GROUP BY YEAR(hire_date)
    ) AS subquery
ORDER BY year ASC;
    
-- 11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?

-- How long do employees work in each department before they leave or are made to leave?

SELECT department, ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(termdate, hire_date)/365),2) AS avg_tenure
FROM hr
WHERE termdate <= curdate() AND termdate <> '0000-00-00' AND age >=18
GROUP BY department;

-- ==========================================================================================
## Summary of Findings

-- There are more male employees.
-- White race is the most dominant while Native Hawaiian and American Indian are the least dominant.
-- The youngest employee is 20 years old and the oldest is 57 years old.
-- 5 age groups were created (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64). A large number of employees were between 25-34 followed by 35-44 while the smallest group was 55-64.
-- A large number of employees work at the headquarters versus remotely.
-- The average length of employment for terminated employees is around 7 years.
-- The gender distribution across departments is fairly balanced but there are generally more male than female employees.
-- The Marketing department has the highest turnover rate followed by Training. The least turn over rate are in the Research and development, Support and Legal departments.
-- A large number of employees come from the state of Ohio.
-- The net change in employees has increased over the years.
-- The average tenure for each department is about 8 years with Legal and Auditing having the highest and Services, Sales and Marketing having the lowest.

## Limitations
-- Some records had negative ages and these were excluded during querying(967 records). Ages used were 18 years and above.
-- Some termdates were far into the future and were not included in the analysis(1599 records). The only term dates used were those less than or equal to the current date.
